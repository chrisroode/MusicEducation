# MusicEducation

About this project. 12/1/2020

This is an open source project to collect music education resources for teaching
and available to the public.  Project is just getting started, so initial tasks
are to create an organization structure and document it for other possible
contributers.

All materials in this project fall under the MIT license.  Do not stick items in
that have conflicting copyright material.  With music examples be sure that they
are either known public domain, or standard enough to be considered common
knowledge.

For example: exercises in concert Bb that are generic and known through the band
community are okay, but the exact band exercises from a particular method book
are a violation of copyright intentions.

Stay tuned!
