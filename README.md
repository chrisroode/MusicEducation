# MusicEducation

About this project. 12/1/2020

This is an open source project to collect music education resources for teaching
and available to the public.  Project is just getting started, so initial tasks
are to create an organization structure and document it for other possible
contributers.

All materials in this project fall under the MIT license.  Do not stick items in
that have conflicting copyright material.  With music examples be sure that they
are either known public domain, or standard enough to be considered common
knowledge.

For example: exercises in concert Bb that are generic and known through the band
community are okay, but the exact band exercises from a particular method book
are a violation of copyright intentions.

#Logistical Notes
-----------------
Music educators are not programmers.  Music educators won't work on the project
if they have to learn how to use git.  However, this git site will remain active
to allow for creation of certain API (application programming interface) and
specific content management needs for the project.

#Project order sketch
---------------------
In order to assemble an effective document with minimal redundant work, follow
the (very changeable) list below of project steps.
 1) creating an effective method of communication between contributers.
 2) Agree on ways to analyze and catalog the individual components of MUED
    - Highly recommend using G-suite because most educators are already forced
      to use it (thank you COVID) and carful organization of data structures
      in sheets translate well to other formats should we decide to change later.
 3) Assemble a set of shared documents that can be used to start collection of
    content.
 4) Start organizing the programmatic needs.
    - Strongly considering breaking down the education process into large assembly
      objects like "Curriculum" "Activities" "Assessments" and then very basic
      objects like "Vocabulary" "Skills" "Concepts" that can be collected by the
      larger objects through a designed API that links them.
    - Also it's a good idea to start thinking about the format for musical data.
      We have musicxml, lilypond, svg images, midi, and many others to choose from.
      Big plus to allow individuals to work with the apps they know, so then how
      do we convert finale documents into web formats.  Having a way to convert
      musxml to lilypond, midi, and svg automatically would be a big plus.
 5) who knows where we go from here.

 #Organizing the data
 --------------------
 Proposed idea will be contained in a google doc...yeah...The more I write, the
 less it will be read...because we need educators on board.
